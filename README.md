<h1 align="center">MyAnimeList</h1>

## About
<p align="center">I created my app using react-native and implementing firebase (database), even though it wasn't feasible, I did it to gather the anime collection. Being part of the creation of this project, made me expand a lot the use of css and react componentization.
</p>

## How to Start
Use "npm i", to install all dependencies.
change the firebase database login on: "./data/config/firebase.js".
use "npm start", to start an application.
and that's it all. but as it's an application with limited dependencies to cell phone use, it can only be tested/used on cell phone, so use or install expo on your cell phone.. and it needs to be on the same network.
if it's an emulator, pressing A, and the expo will do everything by itself.
